# Awesome Agent Skills

> A curated list of reusable skills, workflows, and tool-backed capabilities for AI agents.

Languages: [English](README.md) | [简体中文](i18n/README.zh-CN.md) | [Português do Brasil](i18n/README.pt-BR.md) | [日本語](i18n/README.ja.md) | [Deutsch](i18n/README.de.md) | [Русский](i18n/README.ru.md)

This list focuses on reusable capabilities that help AI agents complete real tasks. It is not a prompt dump. A listed project should have a clear use case, reusable structure, installation or usage instructions, and enough context to explain inputs, outputs, and safety boundaries.

## What Counts As A Skill

For this list, a skill is a reusable capability package for an AI agent. It may include instructions, workflows, scripts, references, templates, MCP servers, connectors, local app automation, validation steps, or examples.

## Legend

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| Platform | Codex, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, MCP, Generic Agent, n8n |
| Includes | Workflow, scripts, references, templates, MCP server, connector, app integration, examples |
| Status | Active = recent maintenance; Stable = still useful with slower updates; Use with care = valuable but sensitive |
| Risk | Low = mostly read-only or content generation; Medium = files, APIs, accounts, browser automation; High = production, security, deletion, payments, credentials, bulk actions |

## Evaluation Method

Skills are scored before inclusion. Stars are a weak signal only; a niche skill can be included when it solves a real task, has reusable structure, and gives agents enough instructions or tools to run safely.

| Area | Points | What reviewers check |
|---|---:|---|
| Task clarity | 0-2 | Clear real-world use case, inputs, outputs, and target user. |
| Reusable structure | 0-2 | More than a prompt: skill files, workflows, templates, scripts, examples, or references. |
| Platform and tool fit | 0-2 | Clear support for Codex, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, MCP, n8n, CLI, browser, API, or local app workflows. |
| Validation and examples | 0-2 | Demo, tests, sample usage, CI checks, schema, or step-by-step verification. |
| Maintenance and safety | 0-2 | Recent activity, license clarity, safe defaults, confirmation rules, and credential/privacy guidance. |

Inclusion guide: 8-10 = recommended, 6-7 = acceptable with caveats, 4-5 = use with care or re-review, below 4 = remove or do not include. High-risk workflows need a stronger score and explicit safety notes.
